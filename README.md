## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/Princinho/devchallenges-button-challenge/raw/master/public/buttons-demo.png)

This was a really fun challenge.
 Demo can be found here <a href="https://dynamic-crepe-48ff34.netlify.app/">https://dynamic-crepe-48ff34.netlify.app/</a>
Translating the react props with conditionnal rendering to select render the classes with respect for the props given was a blast to figure out.
I have improved creating reusable components with different props that translate into css styling accordingly?
Really learned a lot and built some muscle memory
